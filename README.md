	Papirus-Extra-Folders
</h3>


I made Papirus Extra Folders inspired by the [Papirus-Maia](https://github.com/Ste74/papirus-maia-icon-theme).

The reason Papirus Extra Folders exists is to simplify the use of the Papirus icon theme color variations, and also to enable them to be used in Snap applications.

## Usage

You can download the created folders with the icons [here](https://github.com/Kyuyrii/papirus-extra-folders/releases/tag/2025-06-30-icons)

#### If you prefer to generate the folders with papirus-folders, follow these instructions:
